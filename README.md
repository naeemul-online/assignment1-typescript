# Interfaces vs Types in TypeScript: Key Differences

TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, provides robust tools for defining the shape of data: **interfaces** and **types**. While both are used to describe object structures and enforce type safety, they have distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different scenarios. This blog explores the key differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript, helping developers choose the right tool for their needs.

## 1. Syntax and Declaration

**Interfaces** use the `interface` keyword and are primarily designed to define the shape of objects. They have a clean, object-oriented syntax:

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

**Types** use the `type` keyword and are more flexible, allowing you to define not only objects but also unions, intersections, and primitive types:

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
} | string;
```

**Key Difference**: Interfaces are limited to describing object-like structures, while types can represent a broader range of constructs, including unions and primitives.

## 2. Extending and Merging

**Interfaces** support **declaration merging**, meaning you can redefine an interface with the same name, and TypeScript will combine the definitions:

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
}
interface User {
  age: number;
}
// Combined: { name: string; age: number; }
```

Interfaces can also be extended using the `extends` keyword:

```ts
interface Admin extends User {
  role: string;
}
```

**Types** do **not** support declaration merging. However, they can be extended using **intersection types** (`&`):

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
};
type Admin = User & {
  role: string;
};
```

**Key Difference**: Interfaces are more flexible for declaration merging, while types rely on intersections, which can sometimes lead to more complex type computations.

## 3. Use Cases and Flexibility

**Interfaces** are ideal for defining contracts, especially for objects, classes, or APIs. They are commonly used when you expect to extend or merge types later:

```ts
interface Printable {
  print(): void;
}
class Document implements Printable {
  print() {
    console.log("Printing...");
  }
}
```

**Types** are more versatile and can describe complex scenarios:

```ts
type ID = string | number;
type Status = "success" | "error" | "loading";
```

**Key Difference**: Use interfaces for object-oriented contracts and extensibility; use types for complex, flexible type definitions.

## 4. Performance Considerations

While the performance difference is often negligible, **interfaces** can be slightly more efficient in TypeScript’s type-checking process because they are cached internally. **Types**, especially those involving complex unions or intersections, may require more computation during type resolution.

**Key Difference**: Interfaces may offer a slight performance edge in large projects with heavy type-checking.

## 5. Community and Convention

In many TypeScript projects, **interfaces** are preferred for defining object shapes due to their cleaner syntax and declaration merging capabilities. However, **types** are often used when working with utilities, unions, or advanced type logic, as they align better with functional programming paradigms.

**Key Difference**: Interfaces are more common in object-oriented codebases, while types are favored in functional or utility-heavy code.

## When to Use Which?

### Use **Interfaces** when:

* Defining object shapes for classes or APIs.
* You need declaration merging (e.g., extending external libraries).
* Working in an object-oriented codebase.

### Use **Types** when:

* Defining unions, intersections, or primitive types.
* Working with complex type logic or utilities.
* You need flexibility beyond object shapes.

## Conclusion

Both **interfaces** and **types** are powerful tools in TypeScript, and understanding their differences allows developers to write more maintainable and type-safe code. Interfaces shine in scenarios requiring extensibility and object-oriented design, while types offer unmatched flexibility for complex type definitions. By choosing the right tool based on your project’s needs, you can leverage TypeScript’s full potential to build robust applications.
